REGISTRY
========

As the term is used here, *registry* is a protocol for communicating
between parties in a traditional server/client relationship.  On the
one hand we have independent nodes which may cooperate as a cluster,
a collection of peers that communicate with one another over links
dedicated to this purpose.  On the other hand we have a single server
which is identified by its nodeID (a 20- or 32-byte value).  The 
server has a well-known address, a tcp/ip port in an address region,
an overlay, shared by the nodes wishing to form a cluster.  It also
has a well-known RSA public key.

Clients join a cluster by sending a Hello message to the server.  The Hello
is encrypted using the server's RSA public key.  It contains a salt ("salt1")
and an AES IV and key ("KeyIV") used only to encrypt the reply, the HelloReply.

The HelloReply contains the original salt, another salt ("salt2"), and
the AES IV and key (KeyIV2) used for the rest of the session.   By 
deciphering the salt, the server has proved its identity.  If the Hello
is in some way ill-formed, the server will silently close the connection.  
The client will do the same if the HelloReply is not properly encrypted
using KeyIV or does not contain the correct value for the salt.  From
this point KeyIV2 is used by both sides to encrypt session traffic.
