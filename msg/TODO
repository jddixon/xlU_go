    * Find and fix: something in in_q_test.go causes the test 
        failure count to go up without any error being reported 
        - test on c.Failed() at end of each test says none have failed
    * add NodeID check to Hello handler                                 # DONE

    * "Internal error: nil curCell at depth 0" is almost certainly      # FIXED
        seach on empty peer_map

2013-08-26
    * elaborate encoding_test.go to test all fields, with random
        data where possible
    * in_q.go handleMsg() must update an appropriate field in
        a data structure associated with the peer on receiving
        a keep-alive

2013-08-24
    * now having working PeerMap from ../search; extend in_q_test       # DONE
        to use it
