    * Find and fix: something in in_q_test.go causes the test 
        failure count to go up without any error being reported 
        - test on c.Failed() at end of each test says none have failed
        - usually claims 3 failures, sometimes 2

    * add NodeID check to Hello handler                                 # DONE
    * node/BaseNode has 'name' field, but this is not defined in
        p.proto.
        - should it be?
        - if it is, it should be added to HelloMsg
            * this may cause problems as it is currently not 
                constrained to be unique
                - could require that it be a fully qualified domain name
    * Add Salt and Sig fields to the HelloMsg.
        - Salt is 8 bytes of secure random bits from srng, a            # DONE
            SystemRNG instance
        - Sig is an RSA+SHA1 digital signature over id, commsPubKey,
            sigPubKey, Salt, and MyEnd in that order, where the MyEnd
            is optional
        - If a Hello has a bad digital signature we send a BadSig
            error message and close the connection.

    * "Internal error: nil curCell at depth 0" is almost certainly      # FIXED
        seach on empty peer_map

2013-08-26
    * in_q.go handleMsg() must update an appropriate field in           # DONE
        a data structure associated with the peer on receiving
        a keep-alive

2013-08-24
    * now having working PeerMap from ../search; extend in_q_test       # DONE
        to use it
