    * NodeID missing from Hello ?
    * Find and fix: something in in_q_test.go causes the test 
        failure count to go up without any error being reported 

2013-08-26
    * elaborate encoding_test.go to test all fields, with random
        data where possible
    * in_q.go handleMsg() must update an appropriate field in
        a data structure associated with the peer on receiving
        a keep-alive

2013-08-24
    * now having working PeerMap from ../search; extend in_q_test
        to use it
