    * merge selector.go back into key_selector.go

    TRANSLATE
    * TestKeySelector.java -> key_selector_test.go                      * DONE
    * TestBloomSHA1.java   -> bloom_sha3_test.go

    ADJUST FROM 20 BYTE KEYS TO 32
    * key_selector.go
    * key_selector_test.go
    * bloom_sha3.go
    * bloom_sha3_test.go

    * implement Bloom filter (xlattice_j/.../crypto/filters)
        for use in ../reg
        - about 750 SLOC, of which about 450 test
    * then look at Wikipedia article
    * and google on "golang bloom filter"

    * Supposedly RSA believes dual elliptic curve deterministic 
        random number generation algorithm contains a flaw 
        introduced by NSA and so has advised not using it 
        (BBC article today)
        - so review the code
        - do something to scramble the bits ?

    * IMPLEMENT rsa private key to/from wire 
        - pubkey to/from coded and tested
