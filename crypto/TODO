    * filters/bloom_sha3_test.go fails if INCORRECT word size 32
        is replaced with correct word size 64, about line 63
        bloom_sha3.go

    * add backingFile string parameter to NewBloomSHA3
        - alternatively this is NewMappedBloomSHA3
        - size is 2^m bytes = 2^(m-12) blocks
            * so m must be >= 12
        - if parameter is "", not memory-mapped

    * merge selector.go back into key_selector.go                       * DONE

    TRANSLATE
    * TestKeySelector.java -> key_selector_test.go                      * DONE
    * TestBloomSHA1.java   -> bloom_sha3_test.go                        * DONE

    * ADJUST FROM 20 BYTE KEYS TO 32
        - no, don't.  We will use with a mix of SHA1 and SHA3 keys
        - but think about this

    * need to be able to serialize Bloom filters, which can be
        expressed as a need for 
        - BloomSHA3.String()
        - BloomSHA3.Parse()
    * this suggests a need for
        - func (b3 *BloomSHA3) Union(*BloomSHA3) error
        - where the obvious error is that m and k differ
        - this is presumably a merge in place

    * implement Bloom filter (xlattice_j/.../crypto/filters)            * DONE
        for use in ../reg
        - about 750 SLOC, of which about 450 test
            * but counting bloom not yet translated to GO
    * then look at Wikipedia article
    * and google on "golang bloom filter"

    * Supposedly RSA believes dual elliptic curve deterministic 
        random number generation algorithm contains a flaw 
        introduced by NSA and so has advised not using it 
        (BBC article today)
        - so review the code
        - do something to scramble the bits ?

    * IMPLEMENT rsa private key to/from wire                            * DONE
        - pubkey to/from coded and tested                               * DONE
