    * lfs should be validated in node.Node
        - specifically, if it doesn't exist, we should create it
    * default value for reg TESTING can be 
        - name:     testReg
        - lfs:      ./myReg/
        - acc port: 0           // ie, obtain dynamically
    * default values otherwise
        - name:     xlReg
        - lfs:      /var/app/xlReg
        - acc port: 44444

    * reg.New should set name, id, lfs, ckPriv, skPriv, leave o, 
        e, p as nil

    * cluster members can and must be viewable as Peers, and so
        can use node/PeerMap to index members

    * NewReg should create secret keys, store them in data structure    # DONE
        with limited (package) access, pass them to node.New()

    * complete crypto_test 
    * repackage so that the same approach can be used in other
        modules
        - presumably most of this moves to ../crypto/
