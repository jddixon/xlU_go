    * modify in_buffer:readData() to handle partial reads correctly
    * modify in_buffer:writeData() to handle partial writes correctly,
        looping on count until all bytes have gone
    * several tests could obviously benefit from parallelizing: 
        they run one CPU at 100% while the others are more or less idle
        - look at cluster_member_test
        - also reg_cluster_test 

2013-09-18
    * RegCluster.AddMember(): improve handling of attempts to add 
        entries with the same name 

2013-09-16
    * regNode serialization follows practice in ../node: we first
        serialize BaseNode, then rest of Node, then fields of 
        RegNode
        - need Strings(), String(), Parse()

2013-09-13
    * FIX: ClientMsg does NOT include digsig, so server cannot verify
        that the client knows skPriv
    * longer term xlReg needs to be distributed, using Paxos for
        consensus
2013-09-12
    * build and thoroughly test ../cmd/xlReg
    * this stays on main branch
    * deploy on test:44444 as service

    * on regBeta branch figure out how to persist the registry in 
        such a way this it easily loads itself from disk after a 
        crash or reboot
    * when this is stable, merge back into main branch
        - and deploy on test:44444
    * document
    * deploy on salinas:44444
2013-09-04
    * complete crypto_test                                              * DONE
    * repackage so that the same approach can be used in other
        modules
        - presumably most of this moves to ../crypto/
