    * default value for reg TESTING can be 
        - name:     testXLReg                                           * DONE
        - lfs:      ./myReg/                                            * DONE
        - acc port: 33333                                               * DONE
    * default values otherwise
        - name:     xlReg                                               * DONE
        - lfs:      /var/app/xlReg                                      * DONE
        - acc port: 44444                                               * DONE

    * reg.New should set name, id, lfs, ckPriv, skPriv, leave o,        * DONE
        e, p as nil

    * cluster members can and must be viewable as Peers, and so
        can use node/PeerMap to index members

    * complete crypto_test 
    * repackage so that the same approach can be used in other
        modules
        - presumably most of this moves to ../crypto/
