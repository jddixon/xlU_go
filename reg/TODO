xlattice_go/reg/TODO

2013-09-18
    * RegCluster.AddToCluster() and AddMember() should be combined      * DONE
        - first should call the second                                  * DONE
    * handling of attempts to add entries with the same name is poor
    * fix the two failures in TestTopBottomBNMap                        * DONE

2013-09-16
    * add abstraction Registry with components regNode and regData
    * regData serialization includes at least two separate files, 
        one for clusters and one for members

    * clusterMember serializes baseNode + Attrs in that order           * DONE
        - serialize to LFS/.xlattice/members.cfg
            * append-only; members are never actually deleted, but
                perhaps marked as such
        - need Strings(), String(), Parse()                             * DONE
            * this contradicts the append-only requirement

    * cluster serialization includes a list of members by NodeID
        - this is used to recreate byName and byID indexes on load
        - serialize to LFS/.xlattice/clusters.cfg
            * append-only; members are never actually deleted, but
                perhaps marked as such
        - need Strings(), String(), Parse()                             * DONE
            * this contradicts the append-only requirement
  
    * later add utility to compress configuration files, dropping 
        deleted clusters and members

    * regNode serialization follows practice in ../node: we first
        serialize BaseNode, then rest of Node, then fields of 
        RegNode
        - serialize to LFS/.xlattice/regNode.cfg
        - need Strings(), String(), Parse()

2013-09-13
    * FIX: ClientMsg does NOT include digsig, so server cannot verify
        that the client knows skPriv
    * longer term xlReg needs to be distributed, using Paxos for
        consensus
2013-09-12
    * build and thoroughly test ../cmd/xlReg
    * this stays on main branch
    * deploy on test:44444 as service

    * on regBeta branch figure out how to persist the registry in 
        such a way this it easily loads itself from disk after a 
        crash or reboot
    * when this is stable, merge back into main branch
        - and deploy on test:44444
    * document
    * deploy on salinas:44444
2013-09-04
    * complete crypto_test                                              * DONE
    * repackage so that the same approach can be used in other
        modules
        - presumably most of this moves to ../crypto/
