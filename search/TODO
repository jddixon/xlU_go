    * Add peer5 to TestFindPeer
    * Enable Finds on peer5, peer6*

    * TestFind needs to be altered to insert peers in random order
    * FIX: insertion algorithm where you add eg 4 and then 42 
        - should result in nil -> 40 v 42
        - actually gets 4 -> 42, which breaks the rule that says
            if peer != nil then nextCol == nil

    * test behavior in case where duplicate nodeID is added to 
        peer map
