    * Add peer5 to TestFindPeer                                         # DONE
    * Enable Finds on peer5, peer6*                                     # DONE

    * Move TestSameNodeID into ../nodeID/nodeID_test.go

    * Consider replacing the current approach, perhaps with one
        where we have an array of 2^N pointers at each level -
        should be simpler to construct and much faster to search

    * test behavior in case where duplicate nodeID is added to          # DONE
        peer map
        - 08-23 added logic to silently ignore duplicates
