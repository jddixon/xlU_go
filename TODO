    * replace SHA{1,3}_LEN with SHA1{1,3}_HEX_LEN to avoid              * DONE
        conflicts with use of these names elsewhere                     * DONE
    * DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE to 256 KB                                     * DONE

    * uDir.Exists() or variant should take []byte arg
    
2014-03-20
    * the functions with similar names operating on []byte and		    * DONE
        string keys (Exists, KeyExists, etc) need better names		    * DONE
        that follow a regular pattern	                            	* DONE
        - need to transition to the new names, with older names		    * DONE
            available but clearly marked deprecated		                * DONE

    * Code needs checking: carefully compare UFlat and U16x16 etc
        - eg hash != key test, which should use bytes.Equal()

2013-11-13
    * Need tests of
        - GetData()
        - Put()
        - PutData()
        - FileLen([]byte)
        - GetPathForKey([]byte)

2013-10-27
    * merge sha1_test.go and sha3_test.go by adding a usingSHA1
        parameter in the right places
    * investigate and fix: comment says that GetData3 will only
        work for small files (same should apply to GetData1)

2013-10-26
    * u16x16 and u256x256 are trivially different; they should be
        merged and a larger set of directory structures supported
   
    AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION:
    * where rnglib is used to make random file names, use 
        io.ioutil.TempFile(dir, prefix string) (*os.File, error)

2013-10-15
    * CHANGE SHA1_LEN, SHA3_LEN so that, as elsewhere in xlattice_go,
        they are defined as 20 and 32 respectively; or change
        their names

    * some thought needs to be given to thread safety
