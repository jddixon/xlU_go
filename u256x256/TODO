    * FIX: most uses of xf.PathExists ignore errors                     * DONE
    * FIX: many functions (eg CopyAndPut) should return errors
        but don't
    * CHANGE SHA1_LEN, SHA3_LEN so that, as elsewhere in xlattice_go,
        they are defined as 20 and 32 respectively; or change
        their names

    * some thought needs to be given to thread safety
